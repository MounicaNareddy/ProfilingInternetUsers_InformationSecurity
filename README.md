# ProfilingInternetUsers_InformationSecurity
In this project we check if the internet usage of one user is statistically distinguishable when compared to the internet usage of the other users. We have performed this analysis by selecting 3 different time windows 10secs, 227 secs and 5 minutes. We compared the results for each time window in order to check how time window affects profiling.
